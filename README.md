### Pi-Hole Porn Blocklist

While not inclusive of everything, it is more up to date than the original project, or the lists I have combined from Github, aggregate sites, and web searches.  This may break some sites such as Tumblr, and Blogspot as different versions of Pi-Hole block URLs differently.  Please feel free to suggest additions or subtractions. This list is about 15k URLs shy of 2 million lines, and can be difficult to open/review/investigate. 

### Disclaimer
*This project is in **no way** affiliated with the core Pi-Hole project or organization. This project was created as a contribution to the community by providing an updated porn blocklist. Use at your own risk.*

## How to Use
To use, add the following line to your Gravity list
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sidney5101/my-pihole-blocklists/master/lists/pi_blocklist_porn_all.list`
 and then run `pihole -g`, or use the Online updater (Tools > Update Gravity) to update all lists

### Future
May break the list up into multiple, to make it easier to edit/review as 2million lines breaks a lot of text editors.
